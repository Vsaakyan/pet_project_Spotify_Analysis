# pet_project_Spotify_Analysis

# Introduction
In this project I used a dataset from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/most-streamed-spotify-songs-2024/code.
This dataset contains various track information.

# Project content
The project consists of 2 main parts:

## 1. Data Analysis
As part of the data analysis, I did an exploratory analysis, data preproccessing and data cleaning using core libraries for data analysis (pandas, numpy).

## 2. Data Visualization
As for data visualization, in this project I tried to clearly indicate on the graphs certain trends that correspond to the track posted on Spotify using core libraries for data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn).
